Single-cell interactome analysis reveals CCL8⁺CCL13⁺ tumor-associated macrophages as drivers of CAR T cell resistance in large B cell lymphoma. This repository contains computational pipelines for identifying resistance mechanisms through on-treatment single-cell profiling and cross-cohort validation.

We performed the first on-treatment single-cell characterization of the tumor microenvironment following CAR T cell therapy in large B cell lymphoma (LBCL). Through comprehensive single-cell multi-omic profiling and interactome analysis, we identified CCL8⁺CCL13⁺ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as key mediators of CAR T resistance.

Key Findings

CCL8⁺CCL13⁺ TAMs are highly proliferative and immunosuppressive, predicting poor outcomes across multiple treatment contexts
IRF4/IRF8-driven dysfunction in CAR T cells operates independently of canonical TOX-mediated exhaustion
CCL18⁺ TAMs promote immunosuppression via CCR8⁺ regulatory T cells
Resistance mechanisms are conserved between CAR T therapy and chemoimmunotherapy
